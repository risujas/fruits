Implement slowmo with Time.timescale when getting big combos, lerp the speed back up

Implement menu scenes:
	Main menu
	Settings
	In-game settings
	Level selector
	Achievements
	
Add a goal to every level like "destroy all eggplants"

Every level will have a move limit

Add blockers that items will fall around

Add an in-game store that sells boost items
	Additional moves
	Destroy any item on the map

Add visual effects to combos

Add squeaky audio effects when selecting an item

Add splatter audio effects and fruit splatter VFX when items are destroyed

prevent selection when clicking outside of the game board

occasionally make the eyes of the fruit blink with sprite animation

add a juice glass mechanic related to the level goal:
when sets are collected, the fruits get juiced and poured into a glass
the juice has a colour that depends on the average fruit mixture
when a level goal is reached, the glass is emptied and "drunk"
your number of moves is tied to the fill level of the glass, going over the limit means
	that the liquid goes over the glass edge

instead of playing super set sounds for big combos, play them for combos that happen without player input
